# Data Visualization Project

## Data


The [College Basketball Team Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset) provides a detailed breakdown of team performance during the 2024 college basketball season. It includes advanced metrics that evaluate offensive and defensive efficiency, shooting percentages, rebounding statistics, and other key indicators of team success.

### Dataset Breakdown:

- **TEAM**: The name of the team.
- **CONF**: The conference the team belongs to.
- **G**: Number of games played.
- **W**: Number of games won.
- **ADJOE**: Adjusted Offensive Efficiency (points per 100 possessions).
- **ADJDE**: Adjusted Defensive Efficiency (points allowed per 100 possessions).
- **EFG%**: Effective Field Goal Percentage (adjusted for 3-point shots).
- **3P%**: Three-point shooting percentage.
- **2P%**: Two-point shooting percentage.
- **ORB**: Offensive Rebound Percentage.
- **DRB**: Defensive Rebound Percentage.
- **FTR**: Free Throw Rate (free throws made per field goal attempt).
- **WAB**: Wins Above Bubble (a measure of performance relative to tournament qualification).
- **SEED**: The team's tournament seed.



## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

1. **How do different conferences compare and stack up?**  
   Visualize and compare the number of tournament teams and their seeds across different conferences to see which conferences perform best.

2. **Are conferences top-heavy or balanced in their team performance?**  
   Examine whether conferences have a few top teams that dominate or if performance is more evenly distributed across teams.

3. **What is the distribution of tournament teams within and across conferences?**  
   Explore how tournament teams are spread within each conference and compare that to the overall distribution.

4. **How do different seeded teams compare within a conference and across all conferences?**  
   Analyze how teams with different seeds perform within a single conference and compare this to other conferences.

5. **What do conference stat averages look like?**  
   Calculate and visualize average stats (e.g., offensive/defensive efficiency, shooting percentages) for each conference to provide a holistic view of conference strengths.


## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
